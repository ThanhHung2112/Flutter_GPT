# Flutter_GPT

This is a mobile application built with Flutter, integrating OpenAI's API. The app was developed during my internship at BRYCEN company, featuring two main functionalities: a chatbot and a document summarization tool.

This repository contains a Flutter mobile app that utilizes the OpenAI API to power a chatbot functionality. The app interface is designed with multiple screens, including the Home Page, OpenAI key input, Chatbot Screen, and Summarize Screens.

Please note that the displayed below are part of the app's interface and showcase the various functionalities available in the Flutter_GPT app.

Feel free to explore the code and use it as a reference for your own projects or [download the APK](https://github.com/ThanhHung2112/Flutter_GPT/raw/main/assets/app-release.apk) to experience and don't forget to star this üòÅ

## Features

- Chatbot: Utilizing the **LLM GPT-3.5** model with swift responsiveness and naturalness for conversational interactions.
- Summarize Tool: Addressing all questions related to your documents, aiding in swift retrieval and information extraction from various sources.
- Enable **Memory feature** and **Multi-Conversation** for both functionality.

## Installation

You can download the APK file from the releases section of this repository or build the app from source using the
instructions below:

1. Clone this repository to your computer
```
git clone https://github.com/ThanhHung2112/Flutter_GPT/
```
2. Move to the Folder
```
cd Flutter_GPT/flutter_gpt
```
3. Install denpendencie
```
flutter pub get
```
4. If you are new to FlutterFire and you want to use this reponsitory with your own firebase üëâ flow the [Setup flutterfire](#section2)
```
flutter run
```
It may take a while for the first time you build this app.

## Interesting discovery

If you set the API key within the code like this, you can continue to use it even if the key has expired.
```dart
OpenAI.instance.build(
      token: "<<your-api-keys>>",
      baseOption: HttpSetup(
        receiveTimeout: const Duration(seconds: 100),
        connectTimeout: const Duration(seconds: 100),
      ),
    )
```
This trick is quite handy while building code, as it allows you to save time and resources and it still works until 31.07.23.

## Setup flutterfire
